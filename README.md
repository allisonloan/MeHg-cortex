## Abstract

Aberrant neurodevelopment is a core deficit of autism spectrum disorder
(ASD). Here we ask whether a non-genetic factor, prenatal exposure to
the environmental pollutant methylmercury (MeHg), is a contributing
factor in ASD onset. We showed that adult mice prenatally exposed to
non-apoptotic MeHg exhibited key ASD characteristics, including impaired
communication, reduced sociability, and increased restrictive repetitive
behaviors, whereas in the embryonic cortex, prenatal MeHg exposure
caused premature neuronal differentiation. Further single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis disclosed that prenatal exposure to MeHg
resulted in cortical radial glial precursors (RGPs) favoring asymmetric
differentiation to directly generate cortical neurons, omitting the
intermediate progenitor stage. In addition, MeHg exposure in cultured
RGPs increased CREB phosphorylation and enhanced the interaction between
CREB and CREB binding protein (CBP). Intriguingly, metformin, an
FDA-approved drug, can reverse MeHg-induced premature neuronal
differentiation via CREB/CBP repulsion. These findings provide insights
into ASD etiology, its underlying mechanism, and a potential therapeutic
strategy.
